# LINDDUN Threat Catalogue

## L — Linking
Learning more about an individual or a group by associating data items or user actions. Linking may lead to unwanted privacy implications, even if it does not reveal one's identity.

### L.1 Linked data
Linking through identifiers
#### L.1.1 Unique identifier
Linking based on an identifier that is unique (globally or locally, within the system or across the context boundary)

### L.2 Linkable data
Linking through the combination or analysis of data
#### L.2.1 Through Combination
Linking through combination
##### L.2.1.1 Quasi-identifier combining data of a single individual
Linking through a set of attributes that can serve as a quasi-identifier
##### L.2.1.2 Combining data of different individuals
Linking through combining data
#### L.2.2 Through Profiling, derivation, or inference
Linking through derivation or inference

Data of a single individual leads to insights about a larger group of individuals. Knowledge transfers to other individuals through known relations of group membership or similarity.
##### L.2.2.3 Profiling an individual through (dis)similarity
Applying methods to assess uniqueness or similarity to predict relevant properties.

## I — Identifying
Identifying threats arise when the identity of individuals can be revealed through leaks, deduction, or inference in cases where this is not desired.

### I.1 Identified information
Identified Information is requested or processed.
#### I.1.1 Processing of identified data
The system requests and processes identified data
#### I.1.2 Identified information in metadata
The metadata of files or communication involves identified information.

### I.2 Identifiable information
The system processes identifiable information from which the identity of the data subject may be derived.
#### I.2.1 Pseudonym
The data contains unique references to the identity of the data subject.
##### I.2.1.1 Identifier
The data contains a unique reference to the identity of the data subject.
##### I.2.1.2 Quasi-identifier
The data contains combinations of attributes that are unique to a data subject.
#### I.2.2 Revealing attributes
A number of revealing attributes are included in the data which support the identification of the data subject.
#### I.2.3 The data subject is distinguishable from others
The anonymity set is too small, which allows singling out an individual data subject.

## NR — Non-repudiation
Non-repudiation threats pertain to situations where an individual can no longer deny specific claims.

### NR.1 Attributable data evidence
A data record or message is (or can be) attributed to a user or data subject.
#### NR.1.1 Data
Data can be used to prevent an individual from denying certain claims.
#### NR.1.2 Signed data
Signed data can prevent deniability.
#### NR.1.3 Metadata
Metadata can contain unintended data impacting deniability claims about that data.
#### NR.1.4 Embedded/Hidden Data
Embedded or hidden data can be used to reveal additional information impacting deniability claims about the data.

### NR.2 Attributable action side-effect evidence
Action side-effects can cause an action to be attributable to an individual.

## D — Detecting
Detecting threats pertain to situations where the involvement, participation, or membership of an individual can be deduced through observation.

### D.1 Observed communications
Detecting through observed communications

### D.2 Application side effect
Detecting through (trans)action side effects

### D.3 System responses
The existence of an item of interest is revealed in a system response (which can be evoked deliberately or given accidentally).

## DD — Data Disclosure
Data disclosure threats represent cases in which disclosures of personal data to, within, and from the system are considered problematic.

### DD.1 Unnecessary data types
Depending on the context, data can be perceived highly sensitive, and should therefore only be collected and processed when strictly required.
#### DD.1.1 Data type sensitivity
More sensitive data types are collected than functionally required by the system.
#### DD.1.2 Data type granularity
Disclosed personal data is of a more fine-grained level of granularity than needed.
#### DD.1.3 Data type encoding
The encoding of the data includes additional personal data that is not functionally needed.

### DD.2 Excessive volume
The characteristic involves the volume of personal data that is collected and processed.
#### DD.2.1 Amount
An excessive amount of personal data is processed beyond what is functionally needed.
#### DD.2.2 Frequency
Personal data is processed more frequently than functionally needed.
#### DD.2.3 Involved data subjects
Personal data is processed of more data subjects than functionally needed.

### DD.3 Unnecessary processing
This characteristic considers whether the processing and treatment of the personal data is actually necessary for achieving the functional goals of the system.
#### DD.3.1 Treatment, analysis, enrichment, transformation
Personal data is further treated, analyzed, and enriched in a way that is not necessary to achieve the functionality of the system.
#### DD.3.2 Propagation
Data is accessible by or propagated to other services where it is not needed.
#### DD.3.3 Implicit data disclosure
Data is implicitly collected as a side-effect of explicit data disclosures or data flows.
#### DD.3.4 Duration/retention
Personal data is processed or kept longer than functionally needed.

### DD.4 Involved parties and exposure
Personal data is excessively exposed, either to external parties known and anticipated at design time (which are typically limited, targeted and scoped), or it is published or broadcasted by the system (which greatly amplifies the potential risk).
#### DD.4.1 Involved parties
Personal data made accessible to more parties than functionally necessary.
##### DD.4.1.1 Predetermined set of parties
The parties with whom personal data is shared are known up front. This set of parties is static and fixed.
##### DD.4.1.2 Dynamic set of parties
The parties with whom personal data is shared are determined dynamically and may change frequently.
#### DD.4.2 Availability/accessibility of data
Personal data is published more broadly than necessary.

## U — Unawareness and Unintervenability
Unawareness and unintervenability threats occur when individuals are insufficiently informed, involved, or empowered with respect to the processing of their personal data.

### U.1 Unawareness of processing
#### U.1.1 Unawareness as data subject
Unawareness of processing focuses on data subjects not being aware about the collection, processing, storage, or disclosure of their personal data.
#### U.1.2 Unawareness as a user sharing personal data
The user does not need to be the data subject.

### U.2 Lack of data subject control
Lack of control considers the lack of control of a data subject to choose and customize which, how, and how long personal data is processed.
#### U.2.1 Preferences
The lack of control of a data subject to set preferences or consent in how personal data is processed (or collected/stored).
#### U.2.2 Access
The lack of control in accessing the personal data that is being processed.
#### U.2.3 Rectification/erasure
The lack of control in rectifying incorrect data or removing personal data that is no longer relevant.

## NC — Non-compliance
Non-compliance threats arise when the system deviates from legislation, regulation, or standards and best practices, leading to the incomplete management of risk.

### NC.1 Regulatory non-compliance
There are legal consequences of the threats and/or processing activities described.
#### NC.1.1 GDPR
GDPR-related non-compliance threat characteristics
##### NC.1.1.1 Insufficient data subject controls
Support for the different data subject rights is lacking.
##### NC.1.1.2 Violation of data minimization principle
More personal data is processed than is actually needed.
##### NC.1.1.3 Unlawful processing of personal data
Personal data is not processed in a lawful way
###### NC.1.1.3.1 Invalid consent
Personal data collection and processing does not rely on valid consent.
###### NC.1.1.3.2 Lawfulness problems not related to consent
Lawfulness problems not related to consent, such as incorrect lawful ground, automated decision making on sensitive personal data, etc.
##### NC.1.1.4 Violation of storage limitation principle
Personal data is stored longer than needed.
#### NC.1.2 Generic regulatory non-compliance
A general description of non-compliance with regulations (non-specific to a particular legal regime or environment)

### NC.2 Improper personal data management
This characteristic groups a number of data management risks that may have privacy outcomes or vice versa, privacy threats that may lead to overarching data management problems.

### NC.3 Insufficient cybersecurity risk management
A lack of proper cybersecurity risk management with specific attention to the interplay with privacy risks.

### NC.4 Non-compliance with privacy standards and best practices
